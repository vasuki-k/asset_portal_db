Chapter 3: Software Requirement Specification
This chapter provides a detailed explanation on general description, functional, non-functional requirements, assumptions, dependencies, external user interface, performance requirements and design constraints involved in the application.
The purpose of SRS document is to give a detailed overview of the software product, its parameters and goals. It defines the overall architecture and functionality of the project towards the different users. It captures complete description about the working of the system and expectation in performance [1]. It also describes the project's target audience and its user interface, hardware and software limitations and the general constraints. SRS is a comprehensive description of the intended purpose and environment for software under development. The SRS describes what the software will do and how it will be expected to perform. An SRS minimizes the time and effort required by developers to make desired goals and minimizes the development cost. It defines how an application will interact with system hardware, other programs and human users in a variety of real-world situations. Parameters including operating speed, response time, availability, portability, maintainability, footprint, security and speed of recovery from adverse events will be evaluated [2].
The application focus on the logistic management and tracking system. It is a web based logistic management system which supports the current logistic system.it serves as a business software solution for an enterprise which poses operation in domestic and international logistic services.
